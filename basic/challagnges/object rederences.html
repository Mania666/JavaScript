Task for object references:
1. Create an object that describes the car, save it in
variable car1 using let. Inside this
object, enter the properties:
- brand with Chevrolet value,
- name with Camaro value
- year with the date 1966
2. Create a second variable car2 and assign to it
value from car 1.
3. Display in the console the brand property that is
in the car2 object because it is a reference
to an object, so it should be Chevrolet.
4. Add to the property object topSpeed ​​as 220,
use the car2 variable for this. Remember that operator
dots allows not only to retrieve the value of the object,
but with it we can add a new property
along with the value e.g. car2.color = "green";
5. Show in the console the value of topSpeed ​​using
variable car1. Information 220 should appear.
